# Summary

Thanks for stopping by. This is a Simple 5.8Ghz Antenna Tracker. This AAT has been remixed from micromet’s Pan and Tilt for Standard Servo project which can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1941574/
I call this a Simple Tracker because it doesn’t use gears, or bearings. The servos are sufficient enough to do the jobs of panning and tilting a 5.8Ghz patch or directional antenna. Anything larger you may want to consider a different setup. Demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_r5vclBEM8 On to the parts list!! (All parts links are for clarification of parts only. Shop around for the best prices. I am not affiliated with any vendor I have linked to.)

Assembly is pretty straight forward as there are no independently moving parts. You should be able to look at the photos and figure it out. After printing you may have to file here and there for the perfect fit; for the most part everything will go together nicely. After building the Base Plate take some 320 grit sandpaper and run it around the circular part there to remove the layer lines. You can add marine grease to the Pan Mount to help with lubrication. I found it wasn't really necessary. Below are the notes that are needed to assist in planning and assembly.

Note 1: You MUST use this base plate if you are going to use the GWS s125 Sail Winch Servo. Reason being is because the servo disk for that servo (not included with servo!!) is 24mm in width, approximately 2mm bigger than the plastic versions.

Note 2: Note Deleted.

Note 3: This antenna plate was designed for the antenna I have listed in the parts list. The mounting tabs on the antenna plate are easily modifiable in TinkerCad. Just delete everything 3mm above the CAD plane. Don't forget the top antenna mount that prints separately.

Note 4: The ones listed come in multiple lengths. Purchase at least the 1 foot length This is more than enough for 180 degrees rotation. You'll have to pick up some SMA adapters depending on the particular cable you purchase and antenna setup.

Note 5: A second Lewan Soul LD-27MG Servo can be used for the pan servo. It only does 270 degrees. Mine was only able to turn about 115 degrees in each direction (left and right of center). That gave a total of 260 degrees of pan. This is ideal for those that will not fly behind themselves or will rely on the circular polarized antenna when the directional antenna can not point to the aircraft. If you use this as a pan servo print the BASE PLATE STANDARD instead of the 24mm BASE PLATE.

Note 6: Print this part with the circular ring facing upwards. You will need supports for the portions that are touching the build plate.

Notes: 
Print the Rear Plate with supports turned on. There is an intentional space on the left side to allow the ImmersionRC EZAntenna Tracker to slide in. (The servo connector sticks out a bit too far.)
